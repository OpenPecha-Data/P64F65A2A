THE DHĀRAṆĪMANTRAPADA OF BRAHMĀ SAHAMPATINext, Brahmā Sahampati said to the Blessed One:Blessed
One, I will pronounce these phrase of dhrāṇaṇī-mantra in connection with this dharmaparyāya,
to give rise to benefit, goodness, and happiness for all beings (sarvasatvānām arthāya
hitāya sukhāya):

tadyathā | hili mili cili svāhā | brahma svā re svā re svāhā | brahmagarbhapuṣpa saṃstare svāhā
|

Blessed One, this is my protective formula called ‘Brahmadaṇḍa’, which fully prote ted against
all untimely death and appease all evils.
