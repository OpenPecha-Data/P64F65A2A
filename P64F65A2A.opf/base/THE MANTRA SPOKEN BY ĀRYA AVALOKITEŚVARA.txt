THE MANTRA SPOKEN BY ĀRYA AVALOKITEŚVARAFurthermore, at that time, Bodhisatva Mahāsatva Ārya
Avalokiteśvara was seated, present in the aasembly. He said this to the Blessed One:

Blessed One, Here in this turn of the Dharma (dharmaparyāya), I will pronounce these phrases
of the Drāmiḍa mantra:

Tadyathā | hate bihate nihate pratyarthike pratyamitre | śuddhe mukte bimale prabhāsvare aṇḍāre
paṇḍare śvete paṇḍarabāsini | hari kara di | pi Drāviḍa mantragalālṣi dantimukhi | Protect
us from from all untimely death! Protect! By the blazing radiance (tejas) of Ārya Avalokiteśvara,
protect us from all untimely death! May [death] not be seen! Svāhā!
