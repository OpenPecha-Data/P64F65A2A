THE DHARAṆĪMANTRAPADA OF THE FOUR GREAT KINGSAfter this, the Four Great Kings – Dhṛtarāṣṭra,
Virūḍhaka, Virūpākṣa, and Vaiśravaṇa – pressed the palms of their raised hands together in
homage towards the Blessed One, and said this to him:

Blessed One, for the healing of many people, for the happiness of many people, from compassion
for the world, we as well pronounce this dharaṇī-mantra-pada for this dharmaparyāya:

tadyathā | puṣpe puṣpe | dharma ba ri ha ri {parihari?} | ārya-pra śa ste {ārya-praśaṣṭe?} |
niramukte | maṃ gali | stute | ta bi te svāhā |

Blessed One, Sir, this is our protective formula of the Four Great Kings called ‘free of fear/danger’.
If brings safety from all dangers, protects life, and fully protects from all forms
of untimely death.
