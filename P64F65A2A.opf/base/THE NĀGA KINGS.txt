THE NĀGA KINGSThen the Nāga King Sāgara and the Nāga King Śataraśmi??? pressed the palms of
their raised hands together in homage towards the Blessed One, and said this to him:

Blessed One, our great protective formula called ‘wish-fulfilling jewel’ turns away all lightning,
drives away all forms of untimely death, counteracts all types of poisin, and when
there is any threat from gshed byed, byad, zombies (vetāḍa), or inauspicious [events], Blessed
One, we will issue forth from this Nāga realm, and, in order to cast off envy, we will
meditate on compassion, and ???? For what reasons? Blessed One, we the nāgas have envious
minds, and are driven by envy.

tadyathā | ardze | amare | amṛte | akṣaye | puṇyaparyābate | sarbapāpapraśamanāya svāhā | āryapuṇya
so pa kī ye svāhā |

Blessed One, Sir: be informed that if a man or a woman recites the phrases of this mantra with
their tongue, or writes it down in letters, they will not encounter any danger from lightning.

They will not die an untimely death from ‘root poison’, mche ba'i dug, dbyig dug, any other
kind of poison ???. Be secure from all dangers, from all harm!

The Blessed One then said ‘it is well’ (sādhu) to Śakra, Brahmā, the World Guardians, the Lords
of the Nāgas:Auspicious-faced ones (bhadramukha)! You are acting for the benefit of the
many, for the happiness of the many (bahujana hitāya bahujana sukhāya): in order to retain/remember
this dharmaparyāya the expostion of the phrases of the Drāṃidāmantra is good,
it is good. In all place one will be protectin from gnyid log pa myos pa and rab tu myos pa.

When the Blessed One had said this, the monks, Śakra, Brahmā, the World Guardians, and the Nāga
Lords, as well the world with its gods, humans, asuras, and gandharvas, were delighted,
and praise the Blessed One’s teaching highly.
