DHĀRAṆĪPADA OF GUHYAPATI VAJRAPĀṆINext Guhyapati Vajrapāṇi pressed the palms of his raised hands
together in homage towards the Blessed One, and said this to him:Blessed One, I, in the
turn of the Dharma, pronounce the phrases of this dhāraṇi:

tadyathā | muni muni | muni muni | reri | mati mati | sumati | mahāmati | hā hā hā hā |You without
evil – do not fear, by the pronouncemt of khyod Vajrapāṇi! Dṛḍḥā, svāhā!

Blessed One, anyone one who bears in their heart my protective formula, which is invincible
by any other, or writes down the latters, I will protect from all dangers always and continuously.
I will free them from any untimely forms of death!
