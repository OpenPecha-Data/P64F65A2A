DHARAṆĪPADA OF ŚAKRA DEVĀNĀMINDRAThen Śakra, Lord of the Gods, pressed the palms of his raised
hands together in homage towards the Blessed One, and said this to him:Blessed One, I as
well pronounce this dharaṇīpada in this dharmaparyāya:

tadyathā | nibaraṇī | bandha bandha | mā da na dhe | mati mati | tiṭi | go.o ri | gandhari |
[[274b.6]] tsaṇḍali | mataṃgi | ba ra la ni | hīna-madhyama-dhāranī ma la ni | da la matte
| tsakra-pakri | śapari śapari {{ better: śabari = śavari?}} svāhā |

Blessed One, sir, this is my spell (vidyā) named ‘Descent of Vajra tongues’{?}, which frees
from all dangers and fully protects against all forms of untimely death.
