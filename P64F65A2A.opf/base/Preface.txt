Homage to all Buddhas and Bodhisatvas.

This I heard upon a time the Blessed One was staying in Śrāvastī at ???? At that time the Blessed
One said to Venerable Ānanda:

Ānanda, remember this recollection which turns all lightning away, which has is held by the
truly and completely awakened ones of the past as well as by myself.

Ānanda, in the eastern quarter there is lightning called ‘Radiant’ (‘od rather than ‘ong?).
In the southern quarter, Ānanda, there is lightning called ‘Hundred moments/Languages. In
the western quarter, Ānanda, there is lightning called ‘Fading light’. In the northern quarter,
Ānanda, there is lightning called ‘Lord of the stream’.Ānanda, anyone who knows the
names of these types of lightning and knows the regions in which they are found, know that
for that person no danger whatsoever from lightning will occur. After writing down these
names of the types of lightning, lightning will not fall on the place where one resides.

Next the Blessed One recites these phrases of the Drāmiḍa mantra:

Tadyathā: nimi ninimi ninimi ninimi na dhare | Bathing the three worlds in light, trident in
hand, in this spot protect me from all lightning! Protect! Svāhā.
